# Python Best Practice

====================

### Module

 * Very bad

 ```python
 [...]
 from modu import *
 [...]
 x = sqrt(4)  # Is sqrt part of modu? A builtin? Defined above?
 ```
 
 * Better

 ```python
 from modu import sqrt
 [...]
 x = sqrt(4)  # sqrt may be part of modu, if not redefined in between
 ```
 
 * Best

 ```python
 import modu
 [...]
 x = modu.sqrt(4)  # direct import module , sqrt is visibly part of modu's namespace
 ```
